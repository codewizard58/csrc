Back in 1986 I had a ZX Spectrum at home and worked at ICCC which had CDC mainframes. I wrote a C compiler for the CDC machines in Pascal.
I wrote a Forth for the ZX Spectrum and converted the Pascal to Forth. This project has most of the Forth that was loaded on the ZX Spectrum.
Initially I had ZX Microdrives and later Opus Discovery floppy disk add-on.
At some point I was able to transfer from the ZX floppy format to the IBM PC floppy format.
fplus2.4th seems to be missing as is the Z80 assembler part of the Forth system.
